  is there an outlier in the second column. if so, what is it

Variable `dfs: list[pd.DataFrame]` is already declared.

At the end, declare "result" variable as a dictionary of type and value.

If you are asked to plot a chart, use "matplotlib" for charts, save as png.

The user asked the following question:
### QUERY
 Using Python code,Format in such a way that it is easily readable for users, splitting each unique value with commas.

You generated this python code:
unique_values = []
for df in dfs:
    unique_values.append(df['value'].unique())
result = {'type': 'string', 'value': f"The unique values are {', '.join(str(val) for val in unique_values)}."}
plt.bar(unique_values, df['value'].value_counts())
plt.xlabel('Unique Values')
plt.ylabel('Count')
plt.title('Unique Values Count')
plt.savefig('/Users/agastyamishra/eda-analysis/exports/charts/temp_chart.png')
print(result)

It fails with the following error:

```python
# TODO: import the required dependencies
import pandas as pd

# Write code here

# Declare result var: 
type (must be "string"), value must be string. Example: { "type": "string", "value": f"The highest salary is {highest_salary}." }

```



### QUERY
 Using Python code,What is the max value in Low_GOOGLFormat in such a way that it is easily readable for users.

Variable `dfs: list[pd.DataFrame]` is already declared.

At the end, declare "result" variable as a dictionary of type and value.

If you are asked to plot a chart, use "matplotlib" for charts, save as png.

### QUERY
 Can you list all the teams present in the csv file?

Variable `dfs: list[pd.DataFrame]` is already declared.

At the end, declare "result" variable as a dictionary of type and value.

If you are asked to plot a chart, use "matplotlib" for charts, save as png.
